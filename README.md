Idea of this project is to learn modern C (C11),
 and at the same time create something potentially useful, so I chose 
 rfc2161 as target to implement workable, self-contained (inventing bicycles
 along the way!) web server.

Also I'll try to write proper tests, and do all other modern *useful* software
 practices.
